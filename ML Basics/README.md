# ML Basics

Machine learning is a subfield of computer science that is concerned with building algorithms which, to be useful, rely on a collection of examples of some phenomenon. These examples can come from nature, be handcrafted by humans or generated by another algorithm.

Machine learning can also be defined as the process of solving a practical problem by 
1) gathering a dataset, and 2) algorithmically building a statistical model based on that dataset. That statistical model is assumed to be used somehow to solve the practical problem.

### Machine Learning Types
Supervised, semi-supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement

#### Supervised Learning
In supervised learning1, the dataset is the collection of labeled examples {(xi, yi)}Ni=1.
\frac{\sigma}{\mu}
