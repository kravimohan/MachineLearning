# Predictive Analytics

Predictive analytics is an applied field that uses a variety of quantitative methods that make use of data in order to make predictions

### Categorical variables: 
Variables that can be accepted as values with only a finite number of categories such as gender, country, type of transaction, age group, marital status, movie genre, and so on. Within this type of variables there are two sub-types:
   ####     . Ordinal variables: 
When the categories have some natural ordering: for instance, age groups (21–30, 31–40, 41–50, 51+) or shirt size (small, medium, large)
   ####      . Nominal variables: 
Those categorical variables whose values have no meaningful order

### Numerical variables: 
Variables whose values can vary in some defined interval. There are two sub-types, although the distinction in most cases won't be as important:
   ####      . Continuous variables: 
Those that in principle can take any value within an interval: the height of a person, stock prices, the mass of a star, and credit card balance are examples of continuous variables
   #####     . Integer variables: 
Those that can take only values that are integer numbers: number of children, age (if measured in years), the number of rooms in a house, and so on
