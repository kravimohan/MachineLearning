# Predictive Analytics

Predictive analytics is an applied field that uses a variety of quantitative methods that make use of data in order to make predictions

### Categorical variables: 
Variables that can be accepted as values with only a finite number of categories such as gender, country, type of transaction, age group, marital status, movie genre, and so on. Within this type of variables there are two sub-types:
   ####     . Ordinal variables: 
When the categories have some natural ordering: for instance, age groups (21–30, 31–40, 41–50, 51+) or shirt size (small, medium, large)
   ####      . Nominal variables: 
Those categorical variables whose values have no meaningful order

### Numerical variables: 
Variables whose values can vary in some defined interval. There are two sub-types, although the distinction in most cases won't be as important:
   ####      . Continuous variables: 
Those that in principle can take any value within an interval: the height of a person, stock prices, the mass of a star, and credit card balance are examples of continuous variables
   #####     . Integer variables: 
Those that can take only values that are integer numbers: number of children, age (if measured in years), the number of rooms in a house, and so on


### The Predictive Analytics Process
   1. Problem understanding and definition 
   2. Data collection and preparation 
   3. Data understanding using exploratory data analysis (EDA) 
   4. Model building 
   5. Model evaluation 
   6. Communication and/or deployment 

### 1. Problem understanding and definition:
**Goal:** Understand the problem and how the potential solution would look. Also, define the requirements for solving the problem.

This is a key stage because here we establish together with the stakeholders what the objectives of the predictive model are—which is the problem that needs to be solved and how the solution looks from the business perspective. We also establish explicitly the requirements for the project. The requirements should be in terms of **inputs:** what the data needed for producing the solution is, in what format it is needed, how much data is needed, and so on.

### 2. Data collection and preparation:
**Goal:** Get a dataset that is ready for analysis

### 3. Dataset understanding using EDA
**Goal:** Understand your dataset
EDA is a combination of numerical and visualization techniques that allow us to understand different characteristics of our dataset, its variables, and the potential relationship between them.

Now it is time for we to start understanding our dataset by starting to answer questions like the following:
* What types of variables are there in the dataset?
* What do their distributions look like?
* Do we still have missing values?
* Are there redundant variables?
* What are the relationships between the features?
* Do we observe outliers?
* How do the different pairs of features correlate with each other?
* Do these correlations make sense?
* What is the relationship between the features and the target?

All the questions that we try to answer in this phase must be guided by the goal of the project: always keep in mind the problem we are trying to solve. Once we have a good understanding of the data, we will be ready for the next phase: **Model Building**.
